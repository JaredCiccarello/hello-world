            <p> What a fun, sexy time for you. Quicken! Premiere! You were just a turd out there, you know? 
                You couldn't kick, and you couldn't run, you know? You were just a turd. Are all the guys in hereâ€¦ 
                you know? George Sr: No not all of them. Barry: Yeah. It's never the ones you hope. 
                Her lawyers are claiming the seal is worth $250,000. And that's not even including Buster's Swatch. 
                Hey, it was one night of wild passion! And yet you didn't notice her body? I like to look in the 
                mirror. Did you enjoy your lunch, mom? You drank it fast enough.
                Although George Michael had only got to second base, he'd gone in head first, like Pete Rose. 
                Sister's my new mother, Mother. And is it just me or is she looking hotter?
                I'll be in the hospital bar. You know there isn't a hospital bar, Mother. Well, this is why people 
                hate hospitals. O-kay, who'd like a banger in the mouth? It was the first taste of alcohol Buster 
                had since he was nursing. Second-of-ly, I know you're the big marriage expert. Oh I'm sorry, 
                I forgot, your wife is dead. Aren't you the sweetest thing, spending time with what's 
                left of your uncle. And that is why Jesus was often referred to as the King of Kings. Queens. 
                The King of Queens.
